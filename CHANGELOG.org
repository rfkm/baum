** 0.3.0 / 2015-08-18

   - `safe-read-config` now ignores only =FileNotFoundException=
     - The previous design is very error-prone because any exception
       is implicitly ignored even if it is a parsing error. It is very
       hard for users to figure out why corrupted files are parsed as
       nil.
     - This change affects =#baum/import*=, =:baum/include*= and
       =:baum/override*=.
   - Added =#baum/read=
   - Added =#baum/read-env=
