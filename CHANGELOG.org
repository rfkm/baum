* Changelog

** unreleased

   - Update dependencies
   - Change the default alias of =#baum/eval= reader from =#== to =#eval=
     - This fixes a bug where it is not possible to use the eval-reader with
       other Baum's readers/reducers.
   - =read-config=, =safe-read-config= is now deprecated. Use =read-file=,
     =safe-read-file= instead. The objective of this change is to emphasize Baum
     can be used any other purpose.
   - Built-in reducers are now public
   - Make the merging strategies controllable
   - Check if there is unexpanded reducer and expand it if it exists

** 0.3.0 / 2015-08-18

   - `safe-read-config` now ignores only =FileNotFoundException=
     - The previous design is very error-prone because any exception
       is implicitly ignored even if it is a parsing error. It is very
       hard for users to figure out why corrupted files are parsed as
       nil.
     - This change affects =#baum/import*=, =:baum/include*= and
       =:baum/override*=.
   - Added =#baum/read=
   - Added =#baum/read-env=

** 0.1.4 / 2015-05-11

   - Added =#baum/resolve=

** 0.1.3 / 2015-04-02
